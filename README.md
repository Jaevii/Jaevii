## Hello!👋

## About me
Im a fifth-year student at [Luleå University of Technology](https://www.ltu.se/en) in Computer Science and Engineering with a master in information and communication technology.

## What i'm doing ATM
Currently, I'm working on my master's thesis that explores how post-quantum encryption can be integrated into the WireGuard VPN protocol. The project examines quantum-safe key exchange methods, their performance impact, and how they can future-proof secure network communication.
